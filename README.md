This is the code for a multivariate time series classification model, 
in /deep_learning
there is  transformer/ boost/ notebooks/ and utils/ 
the transformer model is in transformer with its multihead attention layers and a classifier
in boost there is a boosting neural network with base model a lstm RNN, upcoming there will be a GRU as a base model to test its performance on the series later.
in notebooks 
in utils/ there are auxiliary functions to transform the data and merge it into a single file for the models to be trained.
